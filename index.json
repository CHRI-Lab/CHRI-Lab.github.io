This project aims to assess the distracting potential of robot faces based on their human-likeliness. As a first step, this paper reports on our initial findings based on an online study. We used a letter search task where participants had to search for a target letter within a circle of 6 letters, whilst an irrelevant distractor image was also present.  The results of our experiment replicated previous results with human faces and non-face objects. Additionally, in the tasks where the irrelevant distractors are images of robot faces, the human-likeness of the robot influenced the response time (RT).  Interestingly, the robot Alter produced results significantly different than all other distractor robots.  The outcome of this is a distraction model related to human-likeness of robots. Our results show the impact of anthropomorphism on distracting potential and thus should be taken into account when designing robots.","tags":["\"anthropomorphism\"","\"robot design\"","\"human-likeness\"","\"perception load\""],"title":"The Valley of non-Distraction: Effect of Robot's Human-likeness on Perception Load","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Obaid","Wafa Johal","Omar Mubin"],"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"c0ab36859939c48522e46924828ba956","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/obaid_hai_2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-10T04:00:36.444312Z","relpermalink":"/publication/obaid_hai_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Domestic robotic entities are on the rise, out of which, domestic drones are taking place in our society as one of the upcoming interactive technologies that we will see in our daily lives.

It can become challenging for students with visual impairments to perceive these shapes and understand complex spatial constructs. For instance, knowing how to draw is highly dependent on spatial and temporal components, which are often inaccessible to children with visual impairments. Hand-held robots, such as the Cellulo robots, open unique opportunities to teach drawing and writing through haptic feedback. In this paper, we investigate how these tangible robots could support inclusive, collaborative learning activities, particularly for children with visual impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 pupils with and without visual impairments, where they engaged in multiple drawing activities with tangible robots. We contribute novel insights on the design of children-robot interaction, learning shapes and letters, children engagement, and responses in a collaborative scenario that address the challenges of inclusive learning.

Teachers are not necessarily trained to teach the new alphabet, and this could result in a challenge for children with learning difficulties. Prior research studies in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) have proposed the use of a robot to teach handwriting to children (Hood et al., 2015; Lemaignan et al., 2016). Drawing on the Kazakhstani case, our study takes an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together smart solutions from robotics, computer vision areas, and educational frameworks, language, and cognitive studies that will benefit diverse groups of stakeholders. In this study, a human-robot interaction application is designed to help primary school children learn both a newly-adopted script and also its handwriting system. The setup involved an experiment with 62 children between the ages of 7â9 years old, across three conditions: a robot and a tablet, a tablet only, and a teacher. Based on the paradigmâlearning by teachingâthe study showed that children improved their knowledge of the Latin script by interacting with a robot. Findings reported that children gained similar knowledge of a new script in all three conditions without gender effect. In addition, children's likeability ratings and positive mood change scores demonstrate significant benefits favoring the robot over a traditional teacher and tablet only approaches.","tags":[],"title":"A Comparison of Social Robot to Tablet and Teacher in a New Script Learning Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Gargot","Thibault Asselborn","Hugues Pellerin","Ingrid Zammouri","Salvatore M.

Children presenting dysgraphia exhibit difficulties automatizing their handwriting. This can bring anxiety and can negatively impact education. 280 children were recruited in schools and specialized clinics to perform the Concise Evaluation Scale for Childrenâs Handwriting (BHK) on digital tablets. Within this dataset, we identified children with dysgraphia. Twelve digital features describing handwriting through different aspects (static, kinematic, pressure and tilt) were extracted and used to create linear models to investigate handwriting acquisition throughout education. K-means clustering was performed to define a new classification of dysgraphia. Linear models show that three features only (two kinematic and one static) showed a significant association to predict change of handwriting quality in control children. Most kinematic and statics features interacted with age. Results suggest that children with dysgraphia do not simply differ from ones without dysgraphia by quantitative differences on the BHK scale but present a different development in terms of static, kinematic, pressure and tilt features. The K-means clustering yielded 3 clusters (Ci). Children in C1 presented mild dysgraphia usually not detected in schools whereas children in C2 and C3 exhibited severe dysgraphia. Notably, C2 contained individuals displaying abnormalities in term of kinematics and pressure whilst C3 regrouped children showing mainly tilt problems. The current results open new opportunities for automatic detection of children with dysgraphia in classroom. We also believe that the training of pressure and tilt may open new therapeutic opportunities through serious games.","tags":[],"title":"Acquisition of handwriting in children with and without dysgraphia: A computational approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anara Sandygulova","Wafa Johal","Zhanel Zhexenova","Bolat Tleubayev","Aida Zhanatkyzy","Aizada Turarova","Zhansaule Telisheva","Anna CohenMiller","Thibault Asselborn","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"530a07ea8569051cc9f48fe2ae922202","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/sandygulova-hri-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T03:55:01.363162Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sandygulova-hri-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the Republic of Kazakhstan, the transition from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet raises challenges to training an entire population in writing the new script.

With the aim to investigate which learning strategy yields better learning gains, we conducted an experiment with 67 children, aged 8-11 years old, who interacted with a robot in a CoWriting Kazakh learning scenario. Participants were asked to teach a humanoid NAO robot how to write Kazakh words using one of the scripts, Latin or Cyrillic. We hypothesized that a scenario in which the child is asked to mentally convert the word to Latin would be more effective than having the robot perform conversion itself.

While the ability to recognize otherâs perspective develops in humans from childhood and solidifies during school years, it needs to be developed in robotic and artificial agentsâ cognitive framework. In our quest to develop a cognitive model of perspective taking for agents and robots in educational contexts, we designed a task that requires the players (e.g., child and robot) to take the perspective of another, in order to complete and win the task successfully. In a preliminary study to test the system, we were able to evaluate childrenâs performance over four different age groups by focusing on their performance during the interaction with the robot. By analyzing childrenâs performance, we were able to make some assumptions about childrenâs understanding of the game and select the appropriate age group to participate in the main study.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring the Role of Perspective Taking in Educational Child-Robot Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arzu Guneysu Ozgur","Maximilian Jonas Wessel","Jennifer Kaitlyn Olsen","Wafa Johal","Ayberk ÃzgÃ¼r","Friedhelm C.

This emphasizes the development of strategies to further healthy ageing. One important aspect of good health in later life stages is sustained skilled motor function. Objective: Here, we tested the effectiveness of robotic upper limb motor training in a game-like scenario assessing game-based learning and its transfer potential. Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants (n = 18 elderly participants, n = 18 young controls) trained with a Pacman-like game using a hand-held Cellulo robot on two consecutive days. The game-related movements were conducted on a printed map displaying a maze and targets that had to be collected. Gradually, the task difficulty was adjusted between games by modifying or adding different game elements (e.g., speed and number of chasing ghosts, additional rules, haptic feedback). Transfer was assessed by scoring simple robot manipulation on two different trajectories. Results: Elderly participants were able to improve their game performance over time (t(874) = 2.97, p textless .01). The applied game-elements had similar effects on both age groups. Importantly, the game-based learning transferred to simple robot manipulation, which resembles activities of daily life. Only minor age-related differences were present (smaller overall learning gain, different effect of the wall crash penalty rule in the elderly group). Conclusions: Gamified motor training with the Cellulo system has the potential to translate into an efficient, relatively low-cost robotic motor training tool for promoting upper limb function to promote healthy aging.","tags":["tangible robots","Task Performance and Analysis","Aging","Gamified activities","Healthy Ageing","motor learning","Robotic exercise","Transfer Learning"],"title":"Gamified Motor Training with Tangible Robots in Older Adults: a Feasibility Study and Comparison with Young","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arzu Guneysu Ozgur","Ayberk ÃzgÃ¼r","Thibault Asselborn","Wafa Johal","Elmira Yadollahi","Barbara Bruno","Melissa Skweres","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"38d58b1363e51d58966c348fd4a15d22","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/guneysu-ozgur-iterative-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T03:42:41.109531Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guneysu-ozgur-iterative-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we investigate the role of interactive haptic-enabled tangible robots in supporting the learning of cursive letter writing for children with attention and visuomotor coordination issues. We focus on the two principal aspects of handwriting that are linked to these issues: Visual perception and visuomotor coordination. These aspects respectively enhance two features of letter representation in the learner's mind in particular, namely the shape (grapheme) and the dynamics (ductus) of the letter, which constitute the central learning goals in our activity. Building upon an initial design tested with 17 healthy children in a preliminary school, we iteratively ported the activity to an occupational therapy context in 2 different therapy centers, in the context of 3 different summer school camps involving a total of 12 children having writing difficulties. The various iterations allowed us to uncover insights about the design of robot-enhanced writing activities for special education, specifically highlighting the importance of ease of modification of the duration of an activity as well as of adaptable frequency, content, flow, and game-play and of providing a range of evaluation test alternatives. Results show that the use of robot-assisted handwriting activities could have a positive impact on the learning of the representation of letters in the context of occupational therapy (V = 1449, p textless 0.001, r=0.42). Results also highlight how the design changes made across the iterations affected the outcomes of the handwriting sessions, such as the evaluation of the performances, monitoring of the performances, and the connectedness of the handwriting.","tags":["tangible robots","handwriting","Gamified activities","Haptic interface","interactive   learning environments","iterative design","Occupational thearpy","Robots for education"],"title":"Iterative Design and Evaluation of a Tangible Robot-Assisted Handwriting Activity for Special Education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Gargot","D Archambault","M Chetouani","D Cohen","W Johal","SM Anzalone"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610789934,"objectID":"523b54ceb9b6dd5a4173735be0149ad5","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/gargot-2020-p/","publishdate":"2021-01-16T09:38:54.301115Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gargot-2020-p/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"P. 114 Automatic assessment of motors impairments in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wafa Johal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604290917,"objectID":"d689616ba8d9b3113f9752188052b110","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/johal-2020-research/","publishdate":"2020-11-02T04:21:56.913233Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johal-2020-research/","section":"publication","summary":" **Purpose of Review**\n\nWith the growth in the number of market-available social robots, there is an increasing interest in research on the usage of social robots in education.

The tangibility of robotics platforms allows for collaborative and interactive learning. Moreover, with these robot platforms, we also observe the occurrence of a shift of visual attention from the screen (on which the programming is done) to the physical environments (i.e. the robot). In this paper, we describe an experiment aiming at studying the effect of using augmented reality (AR) representations of sensor data in a robotic learning activity. We designed an AR system able to display in real-time the data of the Infra-Red sensors of the Thymio robot. In order to evaluate the impact of AR on the learner's understanding on how these sensors worked, we designed a pedagogical lesson that can run with or without the AR rendering. Two different age groups of students participated in this between-subject experiment, counting a total of 74 children. The tests were the same for the experimental (AR) and control group (no AR). The exercises differed only through the use of AR. Our results show that AR was worth being used for younger groups dealing with difficult concepts.

Our new approach transposes Newellâs framework of human actions to model human-robot interaction. Measures from the interaction are sorted into categories (time scales) corresponding to the temporal constraints proposed by Newell. According to this sorting, a bottom-up or top-down analysis can then be performed to correlate variables which allows a better understanding and explanation of the interaction. The utilization of our method within two experimental use cases is then presented. The first one, a child-robot interaction, involves two robots and one child playing a memory game. The second is based on an analysis of the PInSoRo dataset, involving 30 child-robot pairs in a freeplay interaction.

Participants were asked to teach a humanoid robot NAO how to write Kazakh words using one of the scripts, Latin vs Cyrillic.

Advancements in recent technologies provide solutions to address these aspects where needed. Additionally, through the use of gamification, we are able to increase the motivation for participants. However, many of these systems require complex set-ups, which can be a big challenge when conducting rehabilitation in a home-based setting. To address the lack of simple rehabilitation tools for arm function for a home-based application, we previously developed a system, Cellulo for rehabilitation, that is comprised of paper-supported tangible robots that are orchestrated by applications deployed on consumer tablets. These components enable different features that allow for gamification, easy setup, portability, and scalability. To support the configuration of game elements to patients' level of motor skills and strategies, their motor trajectories need to be classified. In this paper, we investigate the classification of different motor trajectories and how game elements impact these in unimpaired, healthy participants. We show that the manipulation of certain game elements do have an impact on motor trajectories, which might indicate that it is possible to adapt the arm remediation of patients by configuring game elements. These results provide a first step towards providing adaptive rehabilitation based upon patients' measured trajectories.","tags":null,"title":"Designing Configurable Arm Rehabilitation Games: How Do Different Game Elements Affect User Motion Trajectories?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laila El Hamamsy","Wafa Johal","Thibault Asselborn","Jauwairia Nasir","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e518def071be9c71aa150bc89291eef0","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/el-hamamsy-learning-2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T03:42:41.108908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/el-hamamsy-learning-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the design of a novel and engaging collaborative learning activity for handwriting where a group of participants simultaneously tutor a Nao robot.

As a lot of research targets social interactions, the goal here was to determine whether an engagement strategy focused on the task could be as, or more efficient than one focused on social interactions and participantsâ introspection. To that effect, two engagement strategies were implemented. They differed in content but used the same multi-modal design in order to increase participantsâ meta-cognitive reflection, once on the task and performances, and once on participantsâ enjoyment and emotions. Both strategies were compared to a baseline by probing and assessing engagement at the individual and group level, along the behavioural, emotional and cognitive dimensions, in a between subject experiment with 12 groups of children. The experiments showed that the collaborative task pushed the children to adapt their manner of writing to the group, even though the adopted solution was not always correct. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the strategies in terms of behaviour on task (behavioural engagement), satisfaction (emotional engagement) or performance (cognitive engagement) as the group dynamics had a stronger impact on the outcome of the collaborative teaching task. Therefore, the task and social engagement strategies can be considered as efficient in the context of collaboration.","tags":null,"title":"Learning By Collaborative Teaching: An Engaging Multi-Party CoWriter Activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wafa Johal","Sonia Andersen","Morgane Chevalier","Ayberk Ozgur","Francesco Mondada","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"91cbca55285a57db36853cae1bffec9a","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/johal-2019-learning/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T11:07:11.716394Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johal-2019-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Robots bring a new potential for embodied learning in classrooms.

Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. Although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics.","tags":null,"title":"Robot Analytics: What Do Human-Robot Interaction Traces Tell Us About Learning?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wafa Johal","Anara Sandygulova","Jan De Wit","Mirjam De Haas","Brian Scassellati"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e4092c40a199788b4cf48c9571fe2bc4","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/johal-2019-robots/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T11:07:11.715294Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johal-2019-robots/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Robots for Learning-R4L: Adaptive Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elmira Yadollahi","Wafa Johal","Joao Dias","Pierre Dillenbourg","Ana Paiva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f567776878948bb883a897f551308091","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/yadollahi-studying-2019/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T03:42:41.10912Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yadollahi-studying-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of robots as peers is more and more studied in human-robot interaction with co-learning interactions being complex and rich involving cognitive, affective, verbal and non-verbal processes. We aim to study the co-learning interaction with robots in the light of perspective-taking; a cognitive dimension that is important for interaction, engagement, and learning of the child. This work-in-progress details one of the studies we are developing in understanding perspective-taking from the Piagetian point of view. The study tried to understand how changes in the robot's cognitive-affective state affect children's behavior, emotional state, and perception of the robot. The experiment details a scenario in which child and the robot take turn to play a game by instructing their counterpart to reach a goal. The interaction consists of a condition in which the robot expresses frustration when the child gives egocentric instructions. We manipulate the robot's emotional responses to the child's instructions as our independent variable. We hypothesize that children will try to change their perspective more when the robot expresses frustration and follow the instructions wrongly, e.g. does not understand their perspective. Moreover, in the frustration groups, we are interested to observe if children reciprocates the robot's behavior by showing frustration to the robot if it is egocentric. Consequently, we expect our analyses to help us to integrate a perspective-taking model in our robotic platform that can adapt its perspective according to educational or social aspect of the interaction.","tags":null,"title":"Studying the Effect of Robot Frustration on Children's Change of Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Konrad Zolna","Thibault Asselborn","Caroline Jolly","Laurence Casteran","Wafa Johal","Pierre Dillenbourg"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ba90b070c7f02f999cc6183a2b854929","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/zolna-2019-dynamics/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T11:07:11.715786Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zolna-2019-dynamics/","section":"publication","summary":"Handwriting disorder (termed dysgraphia) is a far from a singular problem as nearly 8.6% of the population in France is considered dysgraphic. Moreover, research highlights the fundamental importance to detect and remediate these handwriting difficulties as soon as possible as they may affect a child's entire life, undermining performance and self-confidence in a wide variety of school activities. At the moment, the detection of handwriting difficulties is performed through a standard test called BHK. This detection, performed by therapists, is laborious because of its high cost and subjectivity. We present a digital approach to identify and characterize handwriting difficulties via a Recurrent Neural Network model (RNN). The child under investigation is asked to write on a graphics tablet all the letters of the alphabet as well as the ten digits. Once complete, the RNN delivers a diagnosis in a few milliseconds and demonstrates remarkable efficiency as it correctly identifies more than 90% of children diagnosed as dysgraphic using the BHK test. The main advantage of our tablet-based system is that it captures the dynamic features of writing -- something a human expert, such as a teacher, is unable to do. We show that incorporating the dynamic information available by the use of tablet is highly beneficial to our digital test to discriminate between typically-developing and dysgraphic children.","tags":null,"title":"The Dynamics of Handwriting Improves the Automated Diagnosis of Dysgraphia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wafa Johal","Alex Tran","Hala Khodr","Aykerk Ozgur","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"14ebcbb029697ef75189bfc88c8bd127","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/johal-2019-tip/","publishdate":"2019-12-12T10:12:15.828976Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johal-2019-tip/","section":"publication","summary":"While digital tools are more and more used in classrooms, teachersâ common practice remain to use photocopied documents to share and collect learning exercises from their students.

This paper describes our proposed upper-limb rehabilitation game with tangible robots and investigates the effect of game elements and gameplay on the amount of the performed motion in several planes and percentage of failure by using the data from 33 unimpaired subjects who played 53 games within two consecutive days. In order to provide a more generic adaptation strategy in the future, we discretize the game area to circular zones. We then show the effect of changing these zones during gameplay on the activation of different muscles through EMG data in a pilot study. The study shows that it is possible to increase the challenge level by adding more active agents chasing the player and increasing the speed of these agents. However, only the increase in number of agents significantly increases the usersâ motion on both planes. Analysis of player behaviors leads us to suggest that by adapting the behaviour of these active agents in specific zones, it is possible to change the trajectory of the user, and to provide a focus on the activation of specific muscles.","tags":null,"title":"Towards an Adaptive Upper Limb Rehabilitation Game with Tangible Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The CHILI Lab presented several demo at the Swiss Converntion Center.

Dysgraphia, characterized as a handwriting learning disability, is usually associated with dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia), or attention deficit disorder, which are all neuro-developmental disorders. Dysgraphia can seriously impair children in their everyday life and require therapeutic care. Early detection of handwriting difficulties is, therefore, of great importance in pediatrics. Since the beginning of the 20th century, numerous handwriting scales have been developed to assess the quality of handwriting. However, these tests usually involve an expert investigating visually sentences written by a subject on paper, and, therefore, they are subjective, expensive, and scale poorly. Moreover, they ignore potentially important characteristics of motor control such as writing dynamics, pen pressure, or pen tilt. However, with the increasing availability of digital tablets, features to measure these ignored characteristics are now potentially available at scale and very low cost. In this work, we developed a diagnostic tool requiring only a commodity tablet. To this end, we modeled data of 298 children, including 56 with dysgraphia. Children performed the BHK test on a digital tablet covered with a sheet of paper. We extracted 53 handwriting features describing various aspects of handwriting, and used the Random Forest classifier to diagnose dysgraphia. Our method achieved 96.6% sensibility and 99.2% specificity. Given the intra-rater and inter-rater levels of agreement in the BHK test, our technique has comparable accuracy for experts and can be deployed directly as a diagnostics tool.","tags":null,"title":"Automated human-level diagnosis of dysgraphia using a consumer tablet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thibault Asselborn","Arzu Guneysu","Khalil Mrini","Elmira Yadollahi","Ayberk Ozgur","Wafa Johal","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"a6cab791bd4c3281eff1ded37f6d97ca","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/asselborn-2018-bringing/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T10:59:49.226312Z","relpermalink":"/publication/asselborn-2018-bringing/","section":"publication","summary":" In this paper, we present a robotic approach to improve the teaching of handwriting using the tangible, haptic-enabled and classroom-friendly Cellulo robots. Our efforts presented here are in line with the philosophy of the Cellulo platform: we aim to create a ready-to-use tool (i.e. a set of robot-assisted activities) to be used for teaching handwriting, one that is to coexist harmoniously with traditional tools and will contribute new added values to the learning process, complementing existing teaching practices.\nTo maximize our potential contributions to this learning process, we focus on two promising aspects of handwriting: the visual perception and the visual-motor coordination. These two aspects enhance in particular two sides of the representation of letters in the mind of the learner: the shape of the letter (the grapheme) and the way it is drawn, namely the dynamics of the letter (the ductus).\nWith these two aspects in mind, we do a detailed content analysis for the process of learning the representation of letters, which leads us to discriminate the specific skills involved in letter representation. We then compare our robotic method with traditional methods as well as with the combination of the two methods, in order to discover which of these skills can benefit from the use of Cellulo.\nAs handwriting is taught from age 5, we conducted our experiments with 17 five-year-old children in a public school. Results show a clear potential of our robot-assisted learning activities, with a visible improvement in certain skills of handwriting, most notably in creating the ductus of the letters, discriminating a letter among others and in the average handwriting speed.\nMoreover, we show that the benefit of our learning activities to the handwriting process increases when it is used after traditional learning methods. These results lead to the initial insights into how such a tangible robotic learning technology may be used to create cost-effective collaborative scenarios for the learning of handwriting.

The interaction is structured with robot reading to the child and sometimes making mistakes as the robot is considered to be in the learning phase. Child corrects the robot by giving it instant feedbacks. To understand what kind of behavior can be more constructive to the interaction especially in helping the child, we evaluated the effect of a deictic gesture, namely pointing on the child's ability to find reading mistakes made by the robot. We designed three types of mistakes corresponding to different levels of reading mastery. We tested our system in a within-subject experiment with 16 children. We split children into a high and low reading proficiency even-though they were all beginners. For the high reading proficiency group, we observed that pointing gestures were beneficial for recognizing some types of mistakes that the robot made. For the earlier stage group of readers pointing were helping to find mistakes that were raised upon a mismatch between text and illustrations. However, surprisingly, for this same group of children, the deictic gestures were disturbing in recognizing mismatches between text and meaning.","tags":null,"title":"When deictic gestures in a robot can harm child-robot collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayberk ÃzgÃ¼r","SÃ©verin Lemaignan","Wafa Johal","Maria Beltran","Manon Briod","LÃ©a Pereyre","Francesco Mondada","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"a7703455c6ee33172092ec4d8a078878","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/ozgur-2017-cellulo/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T10:51:36.525732Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ozgur-2017-cellulo/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cellulo: Versatile handheld robots for education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexis David Jacq","Wafa Johal","Ana Paiva","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"868574a51b30c39ab419e7a73cf85a0b","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/jacq-2017-expressing/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T10:51:36.527496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jacq-2017-expressing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Expressing Motivations By Facilitating Otherâs Inverse Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayberk ÃzgÃ¼r","Wafa Johal","Francesco Mondada","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"20bf7cadb088b2c86335061085570055","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/ozgur-2017-haptic/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T10:51:36.526065Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ozgur-2017-haptic/","section":"publication","summary":"The Cellulo robots are small tangible robots that are designed to represent virtual interactive point-like objects that reside on a plane within carefully designed learning activities.

Then, we describe the task-based experimental procedure to evaluate the robot's haptic abilities. We show that our robot is usable in most of the tested tasks and extract perceptive and manipulative guidelines for the design of haptic elements to be integrated in future learning activities. We conclude with limitations of the system and future work.","tags":null,"title":"Haptic-enabled handheld mobile robots: Design and analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thibault Asselborn","Wafa Johal","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"446ad379b2355f18f33cad7501345296","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/publication/asselborn-2017-keep/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T10:51:36.526821Z","relpermalink":"/publication/asselborn-2017-keep/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Keep on moving!

The field of HRI has started to report on how to make effective robots usable in educational contexts. However, many challenges remain. For instance, which interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. This abstract provides a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in social robots designed for learning and describes the aims of the Robots for Learning (R4L) workshop in bringing together a multidisciplinary audience for furthering the development of market-ready educational robots.","tags":null,"title":"Workshop on Robots for Learning: R4L","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the field of human-robot interaction (HRI) as in many other technical fields, an innumerable number of different metrics to analyze the interaction can be found in as many studies. Even-though many of these metrics are not\ncomparable between studies, we observe that the research community in HRI, but also in many other research domain, is starting to seek for reproducibility [10]; a consensus begins to appear concerning common measures that can be used across a wide range of studies. In social HRI, the evaluation of the quality of an interaction is complex because it is very task dependent. However, certain metrics such as engagement seem to well reflect the quality of interactions between a robot agent and the human.\nOne aspect of acceptability of a robot is the home environment in which it is to be able to perceive when it will be solicited. The goal for the robot is to not disturb the user and to be able to predict that it will be solicited. This is something we do all the time as humans (we can see a street vendor approaching us and we know they will talk to us). The process for us human relies on proxemics (speed and angle of approach) but not only.\nIn my work on modeling engagement [11, 12], I used multi-modal data to train a SVM to detect engagement. We\ncollected data from various sensors embedded in the Kompai robot and reduced the number of crucial features from 32 to 7. Interestingly shoulder orientation and position of the face in the image are among these crucial features. If we transpose these features to what humans do, these features seem coherent with behavioral analysis. The previous model aimed to predict the engagement, but once the user is engaged, it is important to evaluate its attitude and mood. Using the COST and HAART dataset, we trained a model to detect social touch. Together with colleagues, we won the Social Touch Challenge at ICMI 2015 improving the gestures recognition from 60% accuracy to 70% training a Random Forest Model.

These styles act like a filter over communicative gestures to transpose a way of performing an action. We used multiple platforms (Nao â humanoid, and Reeti â facial expression) to test this rendering on facial and bodily communication [14]. We showed that these styles were perceptible and could influence the attitude of the child interacting with the robot[15, 16]. More recently, we showed that idle movements (movements that have no communicative intention) when displayed by a humanoid robot increases the anthropomorphic perception of the robot by the user [17]. These findings help in designing more natural interaction with humanoid robots, making them more acceptable and socially intelligent. Research Perspectives: We will be continuing research in this area working within the ANIMATAS EU project (starting in January 2018) on synchrony and how alignment can keep learners engaged in a collaborative task with a robot.\n     ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"2565fa501f241664cf0ff7bc073c37f8","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/project/stylebot/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stylebot/","section":"project","summary":"Generating context aware gestures","tags":["styles","moca"],"title":"Behavioural Styles","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With the Cellulo project [6], a part of the Transversal Educational Activities of the NCCR Robotics, we introduced a new robotic platform which is small and easily deployable. A dotted pattern printed on regular paper enables the Cellulo robots with absolute localization with a precision of 270 microns [7]. The robots also have a new locomotion system with a drive relying on a permanent magnet to actuate coated metal balls [8]. This new drive design allows backdrivability; i.e. it allows the robot to move and to be moved without damaging it. With this system, we also implemented a haptic feedback modality, allowing the user to feel forces when grasping the robot [9]. The robots are connected via Bluetooth to a master (PC or tablet) that handles the logical and computation of the activity. The onboard PCB of the robots only allows for proceeding the localization (image capture and decoding of the pattern) and the control of the three wheels actuation. During two years, we developed several learning activities using the robots. The Figure for example shows the Feel the Wind activity, in which the learners were taught that the wind was formed by air moving from with high to low pressure points.\n  In the Cellulo project, we also started to explore the use of haptic feedback for learners. Haptic feedback enables us to render forces, but also borders, angles, or points. We developed a series of haptic capabilities and small interaction tasks that can be included in learning activities to inform the learner [9]. We tested the haptic feedback with children for instance in the symmetry activity, in which the child is able to formulate hypothesis on the placement of the symmetrical shape and to verify their claims by feel haptically the shape on paper (left Figure). We also tested with some pilot with visually impaired children who were able to explore a map of their classroom using the Cellulo robots. Research Perspectives for Tangible Swarm Interaction and Haptic for Learners: We are now exploring the dynamics of the group of learners in manipulating the robots. The collaboration among learner is not always optimal, and a challenge would be to use the swarm robots to analyses and regulate the collaboration among learners.

This new trilingual education policy aimed at development among the Kazakhs of fluency in three languages: Kazakh, Russian and English. Additionally, a recent decision on the transfer of Kazakh language from Cyrillic into the Latin alphabet was approved by the Kazakh authorities in October 2017 [1] While there are clear reasons for these reforms, there are numerous risks facing the transfer, including risks to increase inequalities in education services (e.g. preference for schools with teachers better trained in English or for Russian-speaking schools), to cause illiteracy in adults in their native language, and to cause disinterest and lack of motivation to write and read Kazakh among Kazakh and non-Kazakh children and adults. Beyond familiarity with local conditions, assessing and managing these risks requires understanding the effects they can have on a variety of those affected including children, teachers, and adults, who on the one hand are comfortably able to read the basic Latin script (e.g. English), but on the other, will not recognize crucial distinctions projected onto familiar graphemes.\nSince 2014, the CoWriter project has explored how robotic technologies can help children with the training of handwriting via an original paradigm known as learning by teaching (LbT) [2,3,4]. Since the children act as the teachers who help the robot to learn handwriting, the children practice their handwriting even without noticing it and stay committed to the success of the robot via the Protege effect. Previous research have shown the motivational aspect of the LbT with a robot for handwriting [3]. However, a long-term effect on learning handwriting skill has still to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, we believe that the CoWriter activity has the required innovative aspect to it and, hence, it can boost the childrenâs self-esteem and motivation to learn the Latin-based Kazakh alphabet and its handwriting.\nThe proposed collaboration aims to benefit from the new Language Planning in Kazakhstan in order to address 1) challenges of training and motivating children to learn and use a new alphabet, 2) cross-cultural differences between Switzerland and Kazakhstan in the context of robots for learning, 3) to develop a novel approach for training teachers and the adult population e.g. a CoWriterâs smartphone version.\nWith this Seed Funding Grant, we propose to initiate this collaboration via two main phases: 1) data collection required for adapting Kazakh language in both alphabets into the CoWriter and 2) implementation of the \u0026ldquo;CoWriting Kazakh\u0026rdquo; child-robot interaction activity.\nThe data collection phase includes collecting childrenâs handwriting data using a Wacom tablet. This data is required for training the CoWriterâs learning algorithm. Then we propose to adapt the CoWriter to the Kazakh alphabet and to explore whether it is the best approach to start the switch from the first graders in comparison to children who already know some English as the Latin alphabet might be easier for them. The implementation phase also includes the CoWriterâs deployment by conducting a series of experiments with children and teachers investigating cross-cultural differences in the classrooms.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"1f74630fb648c43f4c4d2fe7a564ff54","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/project/cowriting_kazakh/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cowriting_kazakh/","section":"project","summary":"A social robot to help the transition from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet in Kazakhstan","tags":["cowriter","handwriting","cowriting_kazakh"],"title":"CoWriting Kazakh","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Many children struggle to find their voice in social situations. They may be shy, suffer from social anxiety, not speak the native language as their first language, be new to a culture (migrants), or have a special need involving communication impairments (e.g., autism, speech, and hearing) [1]. Their voices often go unheard as they find it hard to contribute to conversations and group work, in both face to face and online settings, which puts them at risk for poor socio-emotional and achievement outcomes.\nVarious interventions have been proposed in an effort to help these children integrate better into social settings, including ice-breaking activities, support groups, [2][3]. Another promising alternative is to teach children how to interpret and use humor effectively to facilitate social interaction [4]. Having a sense of humour might help children to reduce stress [5] and ease social interactions, enabling them to overcome their social inhibitions and make friends more easily. Also, humour could promotes childrenâs language, literacy, and inference skills, since understanding jokes require a mastery of language ambiguity, and comprehension [6]. One manner to use humor effectively is by âjoke tellingâ. A joke is the shortest clearly-structured conversation one can have with one or more peers. Telling jokes can help children improve their confidence, socialization, [4], literacy [8], and cultural learning [7]. For example, a child could start a âjokeâ that implies a question. He/she knows the answer, but not his/her peers. Then, he/she has the advantage of knowing what the answer is. This helps him/her to gain confidence. In terms of literacy, telling a joke requires the reinterpretation of the syntax underlying the question, then, understanding the ambiguity in a joke might help them in the comprehension of language [8]. Regarding socialization, this dynamic allows children to take part in role-taking, and understanding what other people needs to know to get it. Also, it can create a positive environment where children can laugh together and share their understanding. In terms of learning, a jokes encapsulate cultural assumptions, for example, differences between pronunciation, a dual meaning of a word, and the structural and ambiguity of sentences [7]. The question this raises is: how can we help children from all walks of life learn the art of telling jokes and importantly feel comfortable, and in doing so, increase their confidence, social skills and even literacy? To help children develop the ability to tell jokes with their peers, we propose leveraging a new interactive technology â voice assistant robots (e.g., Alexa), which have become increasingly affordable and commonplace in homes. These robots, which are portable and have lifelike voices, can model how to tell a joke and using voice recognition software, respond to the jokes that children tell. Children thus have unlimited opportunities for scaffolded practice and can receive timely feedback in a non-threatening environment before telling their jokes to family and friends. In addition to the accessibility and human-like verbal responses of voice assistant robots, robots can be customized to tell jokes that are appropriate for each childâs age, language, and culture. The goal of our project therefore is to enable children to improve their âjoke tellingâ skills by learning the intonation, timing, through interacting with a virtual assistants such as Alexa. Our research project will explore the feasibility of coding Alexa and other voice assistants to be able to respond and engage with children telling a diversity of jokes. Several aspects need to be taken into account when delivering a joke that children can imitate and practice with. We will look into how the timing and intonation will need to be evaluated from the audio recording in order to provide an adaptive feedback to the child training to deliver jokes. This feedback could be from both sides, the voice assistant robot helping the child in how telling jokes, or the child helping the assistant to improve how telling jokes. The final goal is, once the child has learnt how to tell jokes, to understand when and how will he/she be able to share the joke with their peers, and how long might this process take and how would we be able to tell they have become more confident. Finally, an engaging joke-telling learning scenario will need to be designed in order to train children for a long-term impact. Our project will also consider how this might materialize. In the future, virtual assistants will be able to be designed to give encouraging feedback to the child as they interact with it. This could be verbal, visual or both. This feedback could encourage children for finding their voice. Based on the initial findings from the pilot project we would like to develop a more extensive project proposal with the goal of investigating how to develop new interventions using the next generation of interactive robots, such as Olly, whose developers, we are also collaborating with (https://heyolly.com/), that have more scope for providing customized feedback can be used.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"45f8841eb64aea3141bafd94c1162fff","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/project/fyv/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fyv/","section":"project","summary":"Helping children's language understanding through joke telling with home assistant","tags":["affective computing","learning companion","home assistant"],"title":"Find Your Voice","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With the increasing number of engineering jobs, politics have more recently turned towards introduction of engineering subjects in early stages of curricula. More and more countries have started to introduce programming (and even robotics) to young children. However, this constitutes a real challenge for the teaching professionals, who are not trained for that, and are often skeptical to use new technologies in classrooms. Hence, the challenge is to introduce robots as tools to be used not only in programming or robotics based courses, but in the whole curricula in order to make them attractive to teachers as a pedagogical tool. âEducational roboticsâ does not really constitute a research community per say. On one hand, there are scholars working on âhow to teach roboticsâ using robotics platforms such as Thymio and Mindstorms. Some scholars perform research in this domain (for example, measuring which learning activities produce faster learning), but their numbers are scarce, they typically meet in half-day workshops before edâtech conferences (CSCL, AI\u0026amp;Ed, â¦.). On the other hand, one finds scholars who mainly do research on HRI and consider education as an interesting place for testing child-robot interactions. I launched in 2016 a series of workshops to build a Robots for Learning (R4L) research community. The first event was a workshop, along with the RoMan 2016 conference. The event gathered 30 participants from all around the world. The second event was a workshop along the HRI 2017 conference in Vienna, Austria, with 60 participants and 10 presentations. This fall, we hosted the first stand alone event, in Switzerland, for which we invited main actors of research in HRI for Learning. A new workshop is planned for HRI 2018.

This skill enables anticipation and increases the quality of interactions between humans. Within the context of engagement, non-verbal signals are used to communicate the intention of starting the interaction with a partner. In this paper, we investigated methods to detect these signals in order to allow a robot to know when it is about to be addressed. Originality of our approach resides in taking inspiration from social and cognitive sciences to perform our perception task. We investigate meaningful features, i.e. human readable features, and elicit which of these are important for recognizing someoneâs intention of starting an interaction. Classically, spatial information like the human position and speed, the humanârobot distance are used to detect the engagement. Our approach integrates multimodal features gathered using a companion robot equipped with a Kinect. The evaluation on our corpus collected in spontaneous conditions highlights its robustness and validates the use of such a technique in a real environment. Experimental validation shows that multimodal features set gives better precision and recall than using only spatial and speed features.

Works have been done in different modality of interaction such as sight (visual computing), and audio (speech and audio recognition) but some other modalities are still less researched. The touch modality is one of the less studied in HRI but could be valuable for naturalistic interaction. However touch signals can vary in semantics. It is therefore necessary to be able to recognize touch gestures in order to make human-robot interaction even more natural. We propose a method to recognize touch gestures. This method was developed on the CoST corpus and then directly applied on the HAART dataset as a participation of the Social Touch Challenge at ICMI 2015. Our touch gesture recognition process is detailed in this article to make it reproducible by other research teams. Besides features set description, we manually filtered the training corpus to produce 2 datasets. For the challenge, we submitted 6 different systems. A Support Vector Machine and a Random Forest classifiers for the HAART dataset. For the CoST dataset, the same classifiers are tested in two conditions: using all or filtered training datasets. As reported by organizers, our systems have the best correct rate in this year's challenge (70.91% on HAART, 61.34% on CoST). Our performances are slightly better that other participants but stay under previous reported state-of-the-art results.","tags":null,"title":"The Grenoble system for the social touch challenge at ICMI

of intentions is an unconscious cognitive process vital to human communication. This skill enables anticipation and increases interactive exchanges quality between humans. Within the context of engagement, i.e. intention for interaction, non-verbal signals are used to communicate this intention to the partner. In this paper, we investigated methods to detect these signals in order to allow a robot to know when it is about to be addressed. Classically, the human position and speed, the human-robot distance are used to detect the engagement. Our hypothesis is that this method is not enough in a context of a home environment. The chosen approach integrates multimodal features gathered using a robot enhanced with a Kinect. The evaluation of this new method of detection on our corpus collected in spontaneous conditions highlights its robustness and validates use of such technique in real environment. Experimental validation shows that the use of multimodal sensors gives better precision and recall than the detector using only spatial and speed features. We also demonstrate that 7 multimodal features are sufï¬cient to provide a good engagement detection score.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-sensors engagement detection with a robot companion in a home environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One of my interests is to make robots able to autonomously sustain interactions with users, and in order to do so, they have to be able to reason about the usersâ and their environment. During my PhD, I have been working on a Cognitive Architecture able to reason on Emotion, named CAIO (Cognitive and Affective Interaction-Oriented) Architecture [3, 4]. This architecture, based on symbolic reasoning, showed promising results in modeling cognitive processes and specifically allowing decision making based on emotions. As shown in the figure, this architecture works as a two loops process, similar to the Dual-Process Theory - a deliberative loop generating intentions and a sensorimotor loop handling reflexes.\nMore recently, we have been working on second order reasoning in the context of the CoWriter project [5]. In the CoWriter project, the childâs teaches a Nao robot how to write. We use the learning by teaching paradigm to enhance motivation and engagement. In a collaborative learning task between a robot and a child, the idea is to model the childâs understanding and the childâs believes of the understanding of the co-learner robot. This way the robot could detect misunderstandings in view to correct them; or the robot could even create misunderstandings to enhance learning (by fostering questioning). Since my arrival on the CoWriter project, we initiated a project on diagnosis of dysgraphia using data collected via a graphic tablet (Wacom). Our first results using RNN are very promising (a patent and a journal paper have been submitted). This work will later on be integrated in the CoWriter handwriting activities to adapt the learning path according to the diagnosis and the learnerâs handwriting difficulties.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"56381d78247340c21f180f4c2e39fcfa","permalink":"https://CHRI-Lab.github.io/project/caio/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/caio/","section":"project","summary":"Cognitive and Affective Interaction-Oriented","tags":["reasoning","caio"],"title":"CAIO","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Call for Participants We are currently conducting a research project on whether we can determine handwriting legibility solely from a person\u0026rsquo;s handwriting without the need for specialised tests.

Socially aware navigation considers the multi-modal assessment of the group dynamics, group formation inferring, path planning, real-time path adaptation, and human-robot communication. Up to now the research in the field has considered a couple of classical scenarios such as crossing a group in a corridor or passing a door. Limitations in terms of lack of realistic datasets is often mentioned in the field. In this research project, we will aim to design several scenarios involving groups of humans in realistic settings. Our work will focus on three main tasks for the robot:\n approach and join a group, 2) passing by a group and 3) greeting a group. A first step of the project will be to record a novel dataset with rich interactions between the humans (H-H scenarios) and between humans and a teleoperated robot (H-R scenarios). The dataset will be collected at the HRI facility allowing multimodal synchronous recording. After that, a new model for path planning} will be developed. For the model, we will explore rule-based constraints (i.e. not passing between two persons speaking together) and learned constrained using the dataset recorded to infer implicit social norms. Finally, the model will be tested empirically with new users in which the robot will have to take real-time path planning decisions.  Schedule   Expected Outcomes  A dataset featuring different scenarios of groups and spatial interactions will be recorded at the HRI facility in Paddington.

However, studies have found that it also limits communications between peers and teachers, limits physical interactions and that it requires a big commitment on the student\u0026rsquo;s part to plan and stay assiduous in their learning.\nGoals \u0026amp; Milestones In this project, we aim to design and test a novel way to engage students in collaborative online learning by using haptic enabled tangible robots. The project will consist in:\n developing a tool allowing the design of online activities for two or more robots to be connected implementing a demonstrator for this new library that will embed a series of small exercises hilightling the new capability of remote haptic-assisted collaboration evaluating the demonstrator with a user experiment  Topics HCI, Haptics, Robot, Collaborative Work (Training/Gaminig)\nPrerequisites  Skills: C++, Js,  References See Zotero Collection https://www.zotero.org/groups/2419050/hri-unsw/collections/JXBHFMBC\n Schneider, B., Jermann, P., Zufferey, G., \u0026amp; Dillenbourg, P.
